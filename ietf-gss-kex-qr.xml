    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies additions and amendments to RFC4462.
          It defines a new key exchange method that uses GSS-API in a way to
          provide key exchange method that is resistant to attacks by
          quantum competers.
          The purpose of this specification is to provide an easy-to-implement
          upgrade to environments that require resistance against quantum
          computers before widely accepted post-quantum cryptography
          algorithms are established.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC4462">SSH GSS-API Methods</xref> allows the use of
          GSSAPI for authentication and key exchange in SSH. Unfortunately
          for resistence against quantum computers all of the methods in
          that RFC as well as all of the new methods introduced in
          <xref target="RFC8732">SSH GSS-API SHA-2 Methods</xref> derive
          their security from Finite-Field Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve
          Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. Both FFDH and ECDH are believed
          to be vulnerable to attacks using quantum computers.
          This document updates RFC4462 with new methods intended for use
          in environments where use of quantum resistant algorithms
          is more important that the forward secrecy provided by FFDH and ECDH.
          </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Rationale">
      <t>Due to security concerns with FFDH and ECDH against attacks using
          quantum computers, we propose a new key exchange method that does
          not use FFDH or ECDH to agree on a shared secret to derive later
          encryption keys but rather uses GSS-API as a secure communication
          channel to exchange secrets that are then used to derive
          encryption keys</t>.
      <t>To provide resistence against quantum computer attacks the connection
          needs to also carefully select encryption ciphers, and host
          authentication methods.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Document Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119">RFC2119</xref>
      <xref target="RFC8174">RFC8174</xref> when, and only when, they
      appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="New Quantum Resistant Key Exchange methods">
      <t>This document adopts the same naming convention defined in <xref
        target="RFC4462"/> to define families of methods that cover any
        GSS-API mechanism used with a specific SHA-2 Hash.
      </t>
      <texttable>
        <preamble>The following new key exchange algorithms are defined:
        </preamble>
          <ttcol align="left">Key Exchange Method Name</ttcol>
          <ttcol align="left">Implementation Recommendations</ttcol>
          <c>gss-qr-sha256-*</c><c>SHOULD/RECOMMENDED</c>
          <c>gss-qr-sha512-*</c><c>MAY/OPTIONAL</c>
      </texttable>
      <t>Each key exchange method is implicitly registered by this document.
        The IESG is considered to be the owner of all these key exchange
        methods; this does NOT imply that the IESG is considered to be the
        owner of the underlying GSS-API mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        Each method in any family of methods specifies GSS-API-authenticated
        exchanges as described in Section 2.1 of <xref
        target="RFC4462"/>. The method name for each method is the
        concatenation of the family name prefix with the Base64 encoding of
        the MD5 hash <xref target="RFC1321"/> of the ASN.1 DER encoding
        <xref target="ISO-IEC-8825-1"/> of the underlying GSS-API
        mechanism's OID. Base64 encoding is described in Section 6.8 of
        <xref target="RFC2045"/>.</t>

      target="RFC4462"/>.</t>
      <texttable>
        <preamble>IANA is requested to update the <xref

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <section title="Symmetric cipher security">
        <t>Current understanding of quantum computer capabilities suggest
            that symmetric ciphers with keys smaller than 256 bits will
            require less than the current recommended minimal work factor
            of 2^128 operations. As such, connections that use this
            key exchange methods MUST use ciphers with at least
            256 bit keys to provide quantum resistence.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="GSSAPI Delegation">
        <t>Some GSSAPI mechanisms can act on a request to delegate credentials
        to the target host when the deleg_req_flag is set. In this case, extra
        care must be taken to ensure that the acceptor being authenticated
        matches the target the user intended. Some mechanisms implementations
        (like commonly used krb5 libraries) may use insecure DNS resolution to
        canonicalize the target name; in these cases spoofing a DNS response
        that points to an attacker-controlled machine may results in the user
        silently delegating credentials to the attacker, who can then
        impersonate the user at will.</t>
